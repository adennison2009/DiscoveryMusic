Discovery Channel Music, most music used in the discovery show "Storm Chasers".

Music By Didier Lean Rachou


UPDATE: It seems like the website that this music came from got restricted. This will be staying up though unless Discovery Channel contact me to take this down. Oh BTW, the number named folders in the music folder are the numbers for the volume. For Example, in the Warm Grooves folder, theres a folder called "35". This means this is Volume 35 of the album named "Warm Grooves". Hope it helps!
